Project Overview

This project is a modular data transformation pipeline built using dbt (data build tool).

It transforms raw source data into clean, well-structured, and analytics-ready models using a layered modeling approach. The project focuses on maintainability, scalability, and data quality.

The pipeline follows modern analytics engineering best practices and is designed to be easily deployable in both local and cloud environments.
